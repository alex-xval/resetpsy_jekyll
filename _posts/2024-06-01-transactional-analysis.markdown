description: "Transactional analysis (TA) is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on how people interact with each other, breaking down communication patterns into three 'ego states':  Parent, Adult, and Child. It aims to help individuals understand these states and how they influence their relationships and behaviors. As a psychologist with extensive experience in TA, I've helped countless clients recognize and modify unhelpful patterns in their interactions. I'm skilled at identifying ego states in communication and helping clients develop healthier ways of relating to others. My expertise in TA enables me to guide individuals towards improved communication, greater self-awareness, and more fulfilling relationships. I'm passionate about empowering clients to break free from negative patterns and create positive change in their lives."
