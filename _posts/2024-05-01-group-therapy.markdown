description: Group therapy is a form of psychotherapy where a small group of individuals meet regularly with a therapist to work on shared therapeutic goals. It provides a supportive and interactive environment where participants can learn from each other's experiences, gain insights into their own behavior, and develop coping strategies. As a psychologist with extensive experience in group therapy, I've had the privilege of facilitating numerous groups of varying sizes and compositions. I'm adept at creating a safe and inclusive space where individuals feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings. My experience has equipped me with the skills to effectively manage group dynamics, facilitate meaningful interactions, and guide participants towards positive change and personal growth. I find it incredibly rewarding to witness the power of group support and the transformative impact it can have on individuals' lives.
