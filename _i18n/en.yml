    I am a psychologist-consultant with a master's degree in school psychology and extensive experience in guiding students, parents, and teachers, including in crisis situations.

    <li>Strengthening children's self-confidence and adaptability;</li>
    <li>Guiding teachers through periods of change and innovation;</li>
    <li>Collaborating with parents by creating a clear and feasible plan of action in which they feel heard and experience a sense of security in their decision-making;</li>
    <li>Uniting teams and implementing changes.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>My approach is personal and results-oriented: I bring clarity to complex situations and provide practical tools that enable sustainable improvements.</p>
