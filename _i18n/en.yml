    I help people to be, to want, and to be able to be themselves.
    <p><b>What I can help with:</b></p>
    <p>I help my clients find their way back to themselves during life crises:
    <ul>
    <li>Integration into a new society, adapting to a new country, company, or school</li>
    <li>Dissatisfaction with quality of life or relationships with a partner, parent, child, colleague, teacher, or friend</li>
    <li>Mental preparation for job interviews, studies, or exams</li>
    <li>Divorce, infidelity, anxiety, uncertainty, irritability</li>
    <li>Burnout prevention, obsessive thoughts</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Together with your input and my expertise, we explore creative solutions. My services include guidance for individual clients, companies, and teams in the broadest sense. Striving for a more positive self-image and insight into your potential not only influences your view of humanity but also the world around you. Together, we create the path to emotional well-being and professional growth.</p>
    <p>I specifically support emigrants in finding their new 'self' while staying in touch with their old self and experiencing their place in life. I use effective methods and techniques from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), NLP, and art therapy, combined with modern knowledge of neuroplasticity and therapeutic poetry, to promote insight and personal growth.</p>
    <p>My approach is characterized by a light and humorous touch, which my individual clients appreciate as it allows them to feel free to be themselves without a mask. My clients mention that I create a connection and offer a clear overview in various situations, which makes them feel empowered over their own lives. It is my goal to provide a supportive environment in which my clients feel that they have all the possibilities to make positive changes in their own hands.</p>
    <p><b>I do not work with addictions to alcohol, drugs, or gambling.</b></p>
