about:
  line: |
    I am a psychologist-consultant with a master's degree in school psychology and extensive experience in guiding students, parents, and teachers, including in crisis situations.
    My strength lies in quickly understanding the core issues and finding practical, creative, and customized solutions.
    I support schools and organizations in:
    <ul>
    <li>Strengthening children's self-confidence and adaptability;</li>
    <li>Guiding teachers through periods of change and innovation;</li>
    <li>Collaborating with parents by creating a clear and feasible plan of action in which they feel heard and experience a sense of security in their decision-making;</li>
    <li>Uniting teams and implementing changes.</li>
    </ul>
    My approach is personal and results-oriented: I bring clarity to complex situations and provide practical tools that enable sustainable improvements.
