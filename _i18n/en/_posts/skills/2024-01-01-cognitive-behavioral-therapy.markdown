description: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on the interconnectedness of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. It helps individuals identify and modify negative or unhelpful thought patterns and behaviors that contribute 1  to emotional distress or mental health challenges. As a psychologist, I adhere to best practices in CBT by utilizing evidence-based techniques and strategies to help clients develop coping skills and achieve their therapeutic goals. I provide a supportive and collaborative environment where clients can explore their thoughts and feelings, challenge negative thinking, and learn practical strategies for managing their challenges. My approach is tailored to each client's individual needs and goals, ensuring that they receive the most effective and relevant treatment possible.
