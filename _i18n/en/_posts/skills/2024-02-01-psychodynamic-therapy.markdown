description: Psychodynamic therapy is a form of talk therapy that explores how unconscious thoughts and feelings from past experiences can influence current behaviors and relationships. It aims to bring these unconscious patterns to light, helping individuals gain insight into the root causes of their emotional difficulties.  As a practitioner of psychodynamic therapy, I adhere to best practices by creating a safe and supportive space for clients to explore their inner world. I utilize evidence-based techniques like free association and dream analysis to facilitate self-discovery and personal growth. My focus is on fostering a strong therapeutic alliance, where clients feel comfortable delving into their past and present experiences to gain a deeper understanding of themselves. Through this collaborative process, I help clients develop healthier coping mechanisms and improve their overall well-being.
