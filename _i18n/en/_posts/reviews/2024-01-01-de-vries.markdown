description: “Nastya, hi! 😊 You’re so organized 😍😍😍 I’m in awe!!)) You’re absolutely wonderful 🥰 I admire how everything is so well calculated with you!)) I’ve been thinking a lot about our work, and I’m so grateful to you. I see great progress—we’ve worked through so many topics. Thank you so much! And I’m sure that my recent need to clarify relationships is a sign of safety, trust, and a very therapeutic process. I wanted to say a huge thank you for your patience 🤣🤣🤣🤣, for the practices, and for your warmth! I’m taking so much from our work! Some things have become such a part of me that I even forgot I learned them within our sessions. Last week, I went to get a tooth removed, and while I was waiting, I was breathing the way you taught me. 😊 Thank you so much—it really helped!”
