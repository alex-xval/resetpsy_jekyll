description: Going through my divorce was incredibly painful, but Anastasia provided a safe and supportive space for me to heal and find my strength again. Her insights and empathy were truly remarkable.  Thanks to her guidance, I was able to navigate this difficult transition with clarity and confidence. I am forever grateful for her support.
