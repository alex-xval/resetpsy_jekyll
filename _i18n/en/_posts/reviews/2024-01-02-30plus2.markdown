description: Nastya, hi 🙂 Right now, I feel much calmer and more confident (there’s a lot of your work in this 😌). I can talk to my husband and resolve conflicts with less emotional loss for myself 🤞🏻. I’ve definitely stopped picking myself apart so much and have started treating myself more gently. I often openly say that I’m being moody. I’ve started to fool around more! 😁
